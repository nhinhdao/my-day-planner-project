**My Trip Planner** is an application for users to search for places based on search term and location. Users then can view places' rating and reviews and choose places to add to their timetables of trip activities. It was built with rails API back-end and react and redux front-end.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and semantic-ui react to implement application's layout.
